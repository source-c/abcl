<h1>Installing the Java way</h1>

<p>
This page describes one way Java programmers can use to build an application.
In addition to the Java development kit, which is described below, this way
also uses a tool called Ant. Ant is a program familiar to Java developers. It
performs the same sort of tasks that make does for C programmers, ie it
provides a convenient means of managing the compilation and program building
tasks that a complex application requires. 
</p>
<p>
Users of Java IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) such as
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> or
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> can build the ABCL JAR file
within these environments. If you are using these tools you will have already
downloaded the JDK, and these tools already have a version of Ant installed.
See the documentation for these tools if you wish to use these to build the
ABCL JAR file.
</p>
<p>
To install ABCL from the source code as described on this page you need:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the Java runtime system, which will probably already be installed
	on your machine;
	</li>
	<li>the <a href="abcl-pbdoc.html#jdk">Java development kit</a>, which
	you have to download from Sun;
	</li>
	<li>and the <a href="abcl-pbdoc.html#ant">Ant</a> build tool for Java. 
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have these pre-requisites sorted, you can then go ahead and
<a href="#abcl">build ABCL</a>. If you wish to use Linux there are
<a href="#linux">further steps</a> to perform.
</p>
<h2>The Java Runtime (JRE)</h2>

<p>
ABCL needs at least Java 1.5. How do you know if you have this or not? Well,
for Windows users the quickest way to find out is to open a new command window
(click <i>Start</i>, then <i>Run</i>, type <tt>cmd</tt> and click <i>OK</i>).
At the command prompt type <tt>java -version</tt>. If you have the
<tt>Java.exe</tt> executable in your path you will see output similar to this: 

<pre>
C:\>java -version 
java version "1.6.0_11" 
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_11-b03) 
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 11.0-b16, mixed mode, sharing) 
</pre>

<p>
This will work because it is a version later than Java 1.5. However, if you get
this response: 
</p>
<pre>
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
operable program or batch file. 
</pre>
<p>
It means one of two things, either you don't have Java installed, or if you do 
it is not on your path. To check which one it is type: 
</p>

<pre>
dir /s c:\java.exe 
</pre>
<p>
This command may take a long time to run, as it is doing a search of your hard 
drive, which may be large and have many files. (Of course you can, if you
prefer, use the Windows search tool: <i>Start</i> -- <i>Search</i>.) A typical
response may be:
</p>
<pre>
C:\>dir /s \java.exe 
Volume in drive C is Windows 
Volume Serial Number is 7DDF-ABBD

</pre>
<p>
<img class="java-image" src="javajre.jpg">
If you don't get any results then you don't have the Java runtime system 
installed. To install it go to <a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>, and
click the big blue button that is on that page (it's not subtle, as you
can see from the image at right!). Be aware that Java downloads are quite
large, so if you need to install or upgrade your version of Java you should
do this when you have access to decent Internet bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
Your download will be an executable file. When you click the button there
are full details on how to download and install the software on to your
computer.
</p>
<p>
The runtime system includes everything that you need to run a Java program.
This means it has the core executables (eg <tt>java.exe</tt>), as well as
all the supporting library files needed to make Java work with your
particular operating system. However downloading the JRE alone is not
enough...
</p>
<a href="#top">top</a>

<a name="jdk"></a>
<h2>The Java Development Kit (JDK)</h2>

<p>
The JDK is a different beast to the runtime environment (JRE). You need the
JRE to actually execute Java code, and without it nothing will work. But if
you want to go further and write your own Java programs, or compile Java
code written by others, as we do here, then you will need more than the JRE
-- you will need the Java development kit. The JDK gives you the basic
tools to compile Java source code. How do you know if you have the JDK
installed? Well again arguably the quickest way is to just search your hard
drive for <tt>javac.exe</tt> (javac is the java compiler). If you get no
response you don't have the JDK installed.
</p>
<p>
As with the JRE the JDK is available for free from Sun. To download the
<img class="java-image" src="javajdk.jpg">
version you are interested in go to the Sun
website, <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>, click on the <i>Java
SE</i> link to the right and then choose the JDK. Alternatively you can use
their search form -- just enter "JDK". Java comes in various 'flavours': the
SE is the Standard Edition, and is the one you want; the others are EE, which
is the Enterprise Edition, and is used for creating web-based solutions using
Java Bean and Servlet technologies; and ME is the Micro Edition, used to run
Java on small devices such as phones and PDAs. [Now how cool would it be to
have Lisp on your phone? There's a thought!]
</p>

<p>
Make sure you download the JDK, not the JRE (unless of course you want to
upgrade your current JRE to a different version). Sun offers the JDK with some
of its other tools, such as NetBeans. NetBeans is an integrated development
environment (IDE), which lets you edit your code in a window, and then run it,
debug it, and manage your applications all within one package. There is a
learning curve to NetBeans; it is a great IDE, but if you just want to get ABCL
running you don't need all its bells and whistles. 
</p>
<p>
The JDK is even bigger than the JRE. For example, JDK 6 Update 12 is 73MB.
Installation of the JDK follows the same process as for the JRE: save the
executable to disk and then execute it. This does take quite some time, so
please be patient.

<h2>Ant -- the Java build tool</h2>

<p>
Ant is an open source project managed by the Apache organisation, that is
used to manage the compilation and building of larger Java projects. It's home
<img class="java-image" src="ant-apache-org.jpg">
page is at <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a>. To download
this tool go to their <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">
download</a> page. Choose the appropriate package for your platform (for
example Windows users will select the zip archive). Extract the files from
the package. Windows users can either user the built in feature of Windows
explorer: double click on the zip file; in the window that pops up click
<i>File</i> then <i>Extract All</i> (the fastest way to start Explorer:
right-click on the <i>Start</i> button and click <i>Explore</i>).
</p>
<p>
If you are on a Unix platform you can use <tt>tar</tt> to extract the files.
As the package is a tar.gz file you can use the <tt>z</tt> option to tar to
uncompress the archive, before extracting it. This command will both
uncompress and extract the archive in one go (assuming, of course, that your
archive is the 1.7.1 version of ant):
</p>

<pre>
tar zxvf apache-ant-1.7.1-bin.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">installation
instructions</a> are on the ant website. You should read through those to
understand what needs to be done. The description below shows how these
were applied when installing Ant on a Windows sytem. The first action that is
required is to add the Ant bin directory to your system path. From a
command prompt you can type the following commands. The first modifies the
path variable, so the bin directory is visible from anywhere. The second
command executes the <tt>ant</tt> executable.
</p>

<pre>

Ant against the <tt>build.xml</tt> file, which is the file that contains all
the build instructions Ant needs to create the target Jar file. You specify the

Because ABCL is a Java application, it should in theory be possible to run this
on any computer where the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is installed. However, if
you wish to run this on Linux you need to perform the following actions to
allow ABCL to run correctly. If you just run the JAR file, then you will find
the arrow keys (ie up, down, left and right) do not function correctly.
Instead, you get output as shown below (here the keys entered were, in order,

current version of which is in
<a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/rlwrap-0.30.tar.gz">
rlwrap-0.30.tar.gz</a>. Extract the contents to your system. For example, if

cd /tmp

To perform the remaining commands you should <tt>su</tt> to root. This will then
allow you to intall the binary in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. Run the following
commands as root:
</p>
<pre>
cd /tmp/rlwrap-0.30
./configure
make
make install
</pre>


<p>
Now we need to create the file <tt>.abcl_completions</tt>. To do this save
the following Lisp code to a file, say <tt>test.lisp</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
(do-all-symbols (sym)
  (let ((package (symbol-package sym)))
       (cond
         ((not (fboundp sym)))
         ((or (eql #.(find-package :cl) package)
              (eql #.(find-package :extensions) package)
              (eql #.(find-package :cl-user) package))
          (pushnew (symbol-name sym) symbols))
         ((eql #.(find-package :keyword) package)
          (pushnew (concatenate 'string ":" (symbol-name sym)) symbols))
         (package
           (pushnew (concatenate 'string
                                 (package-name package)
                                 ":"
                                 (symbol-name sym))
                    symbols)))))
(with-open-file (output #.(concatenate 'string
                                       (getenv "HOME")
                                       "/.abcl_completions")
                        :direction :output :if-exists :overwrite
                        :if-does-not-exist :create)
  (format output "~{~(~A~)~%~}" (sort symbols #'string<)))
(quit))
</pre>

<p>
Now create the <tt>.abcl_completions</tt> by running this command:
</p>

<pre>
java -jar abcl.jar --load test.lisp
</pre>

<p>
The final <tt>(quit)</tt> ensures this Lisp command returns you to the
command line when it completes. It creates the <tt>.abcl_completions</tt>
file in your home directory. We still need to do one more thing, before we
create the <tt>lisp</tt> executable. If you need to know the path to the
<tt>abcl.jar</tt> file If you don't know what it is you can search for it:
</p>

<pre>
find / 2>/dev/null -name abcl.jar
</pre>

<p>
If this does not return any names, try replacing <tt>abcl.jar</tt> with
<tt>abcl\*.jar</tt>, as the JAR file may have a version number included.
Consider that the filename returned is <tt>/opt/abcl/abcl.jar</tt>, then we will
need the line <tt>ABCL_JAR=/opt/abcl/abcl.jar</tt> in our script. So bearing
this in mind, we can now create a script file that we can call
<tt>/usr/local/bin/lisp</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
ABCL_JAR=/opt/abcl/abcl.jar	# Use your own path here.
JAVA=$(which java)
ABCL="$JAVA -server -Xrs -cp $ABCL_JAR org.armedbear.lisp.Main"
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	exec rlwrap -b "[]()'\" " --remember -c -f ~/.abcl_completions \
				  -H ~/.abcl_history -s 1000000 $ABCL
else
	exec $ABCL "$@"
fi
</pre>

<p>
Now when you use this <tt>lisp</tt> command you will get the keystroke behaviour
you expect.
