ABCL 0.13 runs against SLIME CVS HEAD of 2009-02-14 with the following
errata.

[001] *standard-output* is not correctly bound to the appropiate
      SLIME-OUTPUT-STREAM on the statup of the REPL.
      
      WORKAROUND: Evaluate a self-quoting numeric form in the
                  *inferior-lisp* buffer including the [RETURN]
                  character.  The REPL returns the self-qoting form
                  establishing the correct bindings for the
                  CONNECTION.
