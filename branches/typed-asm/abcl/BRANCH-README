Purpose
=======

The purpose of the branch is to abstract a layer out of
compiler-pass2 to manage byte code emission, with stack and local
types tracked throughout the code emission.

The result should be a layer which collects enough information
to be able to generate "format 50" class files. Additionally,
the layer should provide for a place to hook in other code
backends.

Status
======

The branch is used to record my thoughts and progress on the matter
as well as discuss the general direction with co-developers.

Actual code can be compiled, but isn't used so far.
