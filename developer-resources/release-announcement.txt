Subject: [ANNOUNCE] ABCL 0.18.0 released



On behalf of the developers of ABCL (Armed Bear Common Lisp) I'm glad to
be able to announce the 0.18.0 release.

ABCL is a Common Lisp implementation implemented in Java and running on the
JVM, featuring both an interpreter and a compiler. The compiler targets the
JVM directly meaning that its output is runnable JVM bytecode. The fact
that ABCL is written in Java allows for relatively easy embedding in larger
applications. For integration with existing applications ABCL implements
Java Specification Request (JSR) 223: Java scripting API.


This release features - among lots of other things - faster initial startup,
faster special variable lookup and portable fasl files. You can find the full
