Subject: [ANNOUNCE] ABCL 0.17.0 released



On behalf of the developers of ABCL (Armed Bear Common Lisp) I'm glad to
be able to announce the 0.17.0 release. ABCL is a Common Lisp
implementation implemented in Java and running on the JVM, featuring
both an interpreter and a compiler. The compiler targets the JVM directly
meaning that its output is runnable JVM bytecode. The fact that ABCL is
written in Java allows for relatively easy embedding in larger applications.
For integration with existing applications ABCL implements JSR-223.


This release features - among lots of other things - performance improvements,
a fix for unexpected thread termination due to uncaught exceptions and
example code for running ABCL on Google App Engine. You can find the full
